# CatClicker
A simple project for learning purposes.

The CatClicker project is based on the project used in Udacity's 'Javascript Design Patterns' course.
CatClicker is very simple: click on a the picture of a cat and see the number of clicks.

I will use this basic project to learn other technologies, like:

* Gulp
* TypeScript
* ...
